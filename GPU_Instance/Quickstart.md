- Select Hardware Configuration
  - Choose from the available GPU options:
    - NVIDIA H100: Best for large-scale AI model training.
    - NVIDIA A100: Ideal for AI/ML workloads and data analytics.
    - NVIDIA L40s: Balanced performance for AI inference and graphics workloads.
    - RTX A6000: Great for 3D rendering, simulations, and visualization.

## Connect to Your GPU Instance
Once your instance is running, connect to it using SSH:
```bash
ssh -i /path/to/your/private/key username@instance-ip
```
- Replace `/path/to/your/private/key` with the path to your private SSH key.
- Replace `username` with the username of your instance, and replace `instance-ip` with the public IP Address of your 
instance. You can find the username and Public IP Address information in your instance detail page.
