# Object Storage SDK Reference

Nebula Block's Object Storage service is fully S3-compatible, allowing you to use standard AWS SDKs for various programming languages. This section provides examples and documentation for the most commonly used SDKs.

## Available SDKs

- [Python SDK](Python_sdk.md) - Using boto3
- [Go SDK](Golang_sdk.md) - Using aws-sdk-go
- [Java SDK](Java_sdk.md) - Using aws-java-sdk-s3

## Common Features

All SDKs provide access to standard S3 operations:
- Bucket operations (create, delete, list)
- Object operations (upload, download, delete)
- Presigned URLs generation
- Access control management
- Multipart uploads
- Server-side encryption

## Getting Started

1. Choose your preferred programming language
2. Follow the installation instructions for the corresponding SDK
3. Use your Nebula Block credentials (Access Key and Secret Key)

## Best Practices

- Always use environment variables or configuration files to store credentials
- Enable SSL/TLS for all connections
- Use presigned URLs for temporary access to objects
- Implement retry logic for better reliability
- Use multipart uploads for large files
