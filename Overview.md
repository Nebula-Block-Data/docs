## What are Serverless Endpoints?

[Serverless endpoints](Serverless_Endpoints/Overview.md) are endpoints that host advance generative AI models (e.g. large language models
 such as Meta's LLama). With the ease of a few clicks and signing up into our customer portal,
you can access pre-configured models and use them directly in your projects, almost no setup required! 

## What are Dedicated Endpoints?

[Dedicated endpoints](Dedicated_Endpoints/Overview.md) are similar to serverless endpoints, but are the ultimate solution
for users requiring custom infrastructure and model configurations. With dedicated endpoints, you can deploy
your own AI models onto hardware of your choice.

## What are GPU Instances?

[GPU instances](GPU_Instances/Overview.md) are cloud computing resources that you can rent out for your AI and compute-intensive projects. 
Select your desired hardware and its configurations, and gain access to cutting edge cloud computing resources in minutes.
