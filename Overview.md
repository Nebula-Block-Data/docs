## What are Serverless Endpoints?

[Serverless endpoints](Serverless_Endpoints/Overview.md) are endpoints that feature powerful large language models
(LLMs) such as Meta's LLama and Qwen. With the ease of a few clicks and signing up into our customer portal,
you can access pre-configured LLMs and use them in your projects!

## What are Dedicated Endpoints?

[Dedicated endpoints](Dedicated_Endpoints/Overview.md) are similar to serverless endpoints, but are the ultimate solution
for users requiring custom infrastructure and model configurations. With dedicated endpoints, you can deploy
your own LLM models onto hardware of your choice.

## What are GPU Instances?

[GPU instances] are our final and base Nebula Block product, which enables you to spin up and deploy GPU instances for your
AI and compute-intensive projects in a flash! By a myriad of different configurations and hardware, you can integrate
these virtual machines in your project at a good market price.
