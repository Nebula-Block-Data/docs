## What are Serverless Endpoints?

[Serverless endpoints](Serverless_Endpoints/Overview.md) are endpoints that feature powerful large language models
(LLMs) such as Meta's LLama and Qwen. With the ease of a few clicks and signing up into our customer portal,
you can access pre-configured LLMs and use them in your projects!

## What are Dedicated Endpoints?

[Dedicated endpoints](Dedicated_Endpoints/Overview.md) are similar to serverless endpoints, but are the ultimate solution
for users requiring custom infrastructure and model configurations. With dedicated endpoints, you can deploy
your own LLM models onto hardware of your choice.

## What are GPU Instances?

[GPU instances](GPU_Instances/Overview.md) are cloud computing resources that you can rent out for your AI and compute-intensive projects! Select your desired hardware and its configurations, and gain access to cutting edge cloud computing resources in minutes!
