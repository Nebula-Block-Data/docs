# Overview

This page outlines the different tiers available in the system, their requirements, and the corresponding benefits. All
users have access to our serverless endpoints. The tiers dictate your request and token rates, as well as
whether you have access to GPU instances.

### **Tier Levels and Benefits**
| Tier Level          | Requirement     | GPU Access | Request Rate | Token Rate  |
