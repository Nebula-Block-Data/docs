# Overview

Nebula Block's referral program rewards users for inviting others to join our platform. Each user receives a unique referral code upon signing up, which can be shared with others to earn bonuses and commissions.

## Referral Commission Tiers

Referrers (user making the referral) earn commissions based on the total spending of their referees (user being referred 
by the referrer). The commission structure is as follows:

| Tier | Referees' Total Spend | Serverless Endpoint Commission | Compute Commission |
|------|-----------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------|
| 1    | $0 - $1,000           | 3%                             | 1%                 |
| 2    | $1,000 - $2,500       | 5%                             | 1%                 |
| 3    | $2,500 - $5,000       | 10%                            | 1%                 |
| 4    | $5,000 and above      | 15%                            | 1%                 |
