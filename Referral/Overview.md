# Overview

Nebula Block's referral program rewards users for inviting others to join our platform. Each user receives a unique referral code upon signing up, which can be shared with others to earn bonuses and commissions.

## Welcome Bonus

- If a new user signs up **with** a referral code, the user will receive a **$10 welcome bonus**.
- If a new user signs up **without** a referral code, the user will receive a **$1 welcome bonus**.
- Users who sign up without a referral code can **apply a referral code** later in the customer portal to receive the additional **$9 bonus**.

## Referral Commission Tiers

Referrers earn commissions based on the total spending of their referees. The commission structure is as follows:

| Tier | Referees' Total Spend | Serverless Endpoint Commission | Compute Commission |
|------|-----------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------|
| 1    | $0 - $1,000           | 3%                             | 1%                 |
| 2    | $1,000 - $2,500       | 5%                             | 1%                 |
