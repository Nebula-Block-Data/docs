# Overview
This guide will help you get set up with the Nebula Block APIs. 

## Getting Your API Key
API keys are automatically generated for each user upon account creation. You can view, renew, or revoke your API key in the Nebula Block user dashboard:
- **View/Renew API Key:** Log in to your [user dashboard](https://dev-portal.nebulablock.com/) to view or renew your API key. If you renew your key, the old one will be invalidated.
- **Security Note:** Keep your API key secure. If you suspect it has been compromised, renew it immediately.

## Adding an SSH Key
To access GPU instances securely, you need to add your SSH public key:
- **Add SSH Key:** Log in to your [user dashboard](https://dev-portal.nebulablock.com/) and navigate to the SSH Keys section to add or manage your SSH public keys.
- **API Management:** You can also use the [Create SSH Key](SSH_Keys/Create_SSH_Key.md) endpoint to register your SSH public key with your account, or [List SSH Keys](SSH_Keys/List_SSH_Keys.md) and [Delete SSH Key](SSH_Keys/Delete_SSH_Key.md) for management.
