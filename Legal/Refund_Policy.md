# Refund Policy

**Effective Date:** January 1, 2024
**Last Updated:** January 1, 2024

---

This Refund Policy governs all purchases made through Nebula Block's platform, including GPU compute credits, cloud infrastructure services, and inference API credits.

## Eligibility for Refund

Refund requests submitted **within twenty-four (24) hours** of the original purchase are eligible for a refund of **any unused credits**. Credits that have already been consumed (e.g., applied toward GPU compute time, inference requests, or other platform usage) during that period are non-refundable.

## No Refund After 24 Hours

Any refund request submitted **after twenty-four (24) hours** from the time of purchase will **not** be honored, regardless of whether credits remain unused. All sales become final once the 24-hour window has elapsed.

## How to Request a Refund

To request a refund, submit a ticket through our HelpDesk or send an email to **contact@nebulablock.com** within the eligible window. Please include your account email, transaction ID, and the date of purchase. Nebula Block will process eligible refund requests within five (5) to ten (10) business days.

## Exceptions

Nebula Block reserves the right to deny refund requests in cases of suspected fraud, abuse, or violation of these terms. Promotional credits, bonus credits, and free-tier allocations are not eligible for refund under any circumstances.
