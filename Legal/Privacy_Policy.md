Nebula Block ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting the privacy of our users ("you" or "your"). This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our GPU cloud computing and inference services.

## Information We Collect

**Account Information.** When you register for an account, we collect your name, email address, billing address, and payment information (processed through a secure third-party payment processor).

**Usage Data.** We automatically collect data related to your use of our platform, including API call logs, compute session durations, resource utilization metrics, IP addresses, browser type, and access timestamps.

**User-Uploaded Content.** You may upload datasets, machine learning models, configuration files, or other content to our platform in connection with your use of our services. We collect and store this content as necessary to provide the services you have requested.

**Communications.** We retain records of correspondence when you contact our support team or otherwise communicate with us.

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to: provide, operate, and maintain our services; process transactions and send related notices; monitor and analyze usage patterns to improve platform performance and reliability; detect, prevent, and address fraud, abuse, and technical issues; communicate with you regarding account activity, updates, and promotional offers (with your consent where required); and comply with applicable legal obligations.

## Information Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell your personal information. We may share information with third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf (e.g., payment processing, analytics, infrastructure hosting), in response to lawful requests by public authorities or as required by applicable law, in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, and with your consent or at your direction.

## Data Security

We implement industry-standard technical and organizational measures to protect your information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These include encryption of data in transit and at rest, access controls, and regular security audits. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Data Retention

We retain your personal information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide services. Upon account termination, we will delete or anonymize your data within ninety (90) days, except where retention is required by law or for legitimate business purposes (e.g., fraud prevention, dispute resolution).

## Your Rights

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal information; object to or restrict certain processing activities; request data portability; and withdraw consent where processing is based on consent. To exercise any of these rights, submit a ticket through our HelpDesk or send an email to **contact@nebulablock.com**.

## Cookies and Tracking

Our platform uses cookies and similar tracking technologies to maintain session state, remember preferences, and analyze usage. You may control cookie settings through your browser, though disabling cookies may limit platform functionality.

## Children's Privacy

Our services are not directed to individuals under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware that we have collected information from a child, we will take steps to delete that information promptly.

## International Data Transfers

Your information may be transferred to and processed in countries other than your country of residence. We ensure appropriate safeguards are in place for such transfers in compliance with applicable data protection laws.
