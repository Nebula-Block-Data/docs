## Acceptable Use

You agree not to use the Services to: violate any applicable law or regulation; infringe upon the intellectual property rights of any third party; transmit malware, viruses, or any harmful code; engage in cryptocurrency mining unless explicitly authorized under your service plan; attempt to gain unauthorized access to any systems or networks connected to the Services; use the Services to develop or deploy any product or service that competes directly with Nebula Block; or engage in any activity that disrupts, degrades, or impairs the Services for other users.

All fees are quoted in U.S. Dollars unless otherwise stated. Nebula Block reserves the right to modify pricing with thirty (30) days' prior notice. Failure to pay outstanding balances may result in suspension or termination of your account.

## Service Level and Availability

Nebula Block will use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain platform availability. Specific uptime commitments, if any, are set forth in a separate Service Level Agreement (SLA). Nebula Block is not liable for downtime caused by scheduled maintenance (with reasonable advance notice), factors beyond our reasonable control (force majeure), or your misuse of the Services.

## Intellectual Property

Nebula Block retains all rights in the platform, APIs, documentation, and underlying technology. These Terms do not grant you any rights to Nebula Block's trademarks, logos, or branding. You retain all rights to the content and data you create or upload through the Services, subject to the licenses granted herein.

## Termination

Either party may terminate the account at any time. Nebula Block may suspend or terminate your access to the Services immediately if you breach these Terms or engage in activity that threatens the security or integrity of the platform. Upon termination, your right to use the Services ceases immediately. Sections regarding intellectual property, limitation of liability, indemnification, and governing law survive termination.
