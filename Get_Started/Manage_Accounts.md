# Manage Accounts

## Create an Account

Sign up on the [Nebula Block website](https://nebulablock.com/) to create an account by clicking on [Sign up](https://nebulablock.com/register)
in the top right corner of your screen  and either sign up with email + password or through Google and agree to the terms of services.

## Activate Account

Once you create an account, you need to activate it before you're able to sign in. An activation email will be sent to your account
so make sure to activate it. If the email didn't send, you can resend the activation email.

## Updating Account Information

It is recommended once you create and activate your account to fill out as much information about yourself
for the best experience of using our platform. To update your account information, go to the [Account](https://nebulablock.com/profile)
tab in the [customer portal](https://nebulablock.com/home) and click "Edit Profile"

## Reset Password

If you forget your password, you can reset it via the [reset password page](https://nebulablock.com/forgot).

## Having Multiple Accounts

In the case that you have multiple accounts with Nebula Block, which could be the case for differing needs
or retrieving the free credits on different accounts, it should be noted that you can't add the same payment
card on different accounts. No duplicate payment cards are allowed across accounts.
