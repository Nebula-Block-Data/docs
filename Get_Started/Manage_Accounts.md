# Manage Accounts

## Create an Account

To create an account, sign up on the [Nebula Block website](https://nebulablock.com/) by clicking on ["Sign up"](https://nebulablock.com/register)
in the top right corner and sign up with either email + password or through Google.

## Activate Account

Once you create an account, you need to activate it before you can access the customer portal. An activation email will be sent to your
email automatically once you sign up. If the email didn't send, you can [resend the activation email](https://nebulablock.com/resend-activation-link).

## Updating Account Information

It is recommended once you create and activate your account to fill out your account information
so that the portal can provide you with the best experience. To update your account information, go to the [Account page](https://nebulablock.com/profile)
in the customer portal and click "Edit Profile."

## Reset Password

If you forget your password, you can reset it via the [reset password page](https://nebulablock.com/forgot).

## Having Multiple Accounts

If you have multiple accounts with Nebula Block, it should be noted that you can't add the same payment
card on different accounts. Only unique payment cards can exist across all accounts.
