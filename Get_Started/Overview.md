## Create an Account

To access the [Nebula Block customer portal](https://nebulablock.com/home), which is the home to using our products, you first need to create an account.

Sign up [here](https://nebulablock.com/login) to create an account. Once registered, you can log in and use our services.

See the [Manage Accounts](Manage_Accounts.md) section for more details.

## Add a Payment Card

Once an account has been created, you need to add a payment card to get started with using
our products and receive $10 in free credits!

See the [Billing Information](Billing_Information.md) section for more details.

## Deploy Products

Once a payment card is added, you can use our products. This includes [Serverless Endpoints](../Serverless_Endpoints/Overview.md),
