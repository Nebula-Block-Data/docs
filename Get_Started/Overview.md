In this getting started guide, learn how to create an account, manage your billing details,
and deploy the various Nebula Block products.

## Create an Account

To access the Nebula Block customer portal, you first need to create an account to add your payment
information and access our products.

## Add a Payment Card

Once an account has been created, you will need to add a payment card in the **Billing** section of the customer portal to get started with using
our products and also to get $10 in free credits!

Invoices will be billed out every month for your default payment card and can be downloaded as well.

## Deploy Products

Once a payment card is added, you can use our products. This includes [Serverless Endpoints](../Serverless_Endpoints/Overview.md),
[Dedicated Endpoints](../Dedicated_Endpoints/Overview.md), and [GPU Instances](../Instances/Overview.md).
You can also create SSH keys for your instances and products.
