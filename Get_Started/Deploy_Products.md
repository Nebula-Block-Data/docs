# Deploy Products

## Summary

There are 4 main products at Nebula Block:
- [Serverless Endpoints](../Serverless_Endpoints/Overview.md)
- [Dedicated Endpoints](../Dedicated_Endpoints/Overview.md)
- [GPU Instances](../GPU_Instances/Overview.md)
- [Object Storage](../Object_Storage/Overview.md)

## Serverless Endpoints

These are endpoints that host various generative AI models immediately available to use. 

For more details, see [here](../Serverless_Endpoints/Overview.md).

## Dedicated Endpoints

Dedicated endpoints are like serverless endpoints, but far more customizable. That is, you can select the hardware and the desired model (one of ours or even your own!) and we'll deploy it on its own server. Unlike the serverless endpoints above, 
the server on your dedicated endpoint will serve your workloads exclusively. 

For more details, see [here](../Dedicated_Endpoints/Overview.md).

GPU instances consist of on-demand GPU virtual machines, customizable with a variety of configurations to suit you and your needs for any project.
