# Deploy Products

## Summary

There are 3 main products at Nebula Block:
- [Serverless Endpoints](../Serverless_Endpoints/Overview.md)
- [Dedicated Endpoints](../Dedicated_Endpoints)
- [GPU Instances](../Instances/Overview.md)

## Serverless Endpoints

These are endpoints that contain general LLM models which are exposed to you and able to use.

## Dedicated Endpoints

Similar to serverless endpoints, dedicated endpoints are endpoints containing LLM models that are exposed to you for use in your projects.
However, these LLM models are customizable and the hardware used is up to you as well.
