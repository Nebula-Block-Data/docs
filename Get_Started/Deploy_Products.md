# Deploy Products

## Summary

There are 3 main products at Nebula Block:
- [Serverless Endpoints](/Serverless_Endpoints/Overview.md)
- [Dedicated Endpoints](/Dedicated_Endpoints/Overview.md)
- [GPU Instances](/GPU_Instances/Overview.md)

## Serverless Endpoints

These are endpoints that host various generative AI models immediately available to use. 

For more details, see [here](../Serverless_Endpoints/Overview.md).

## Dedicated Endpoints

Dedicated endpoints are like serverless endpoints, but far more customizable. That is, you can select the hardware and the desired model (one of ours or even your own!) and we'll deploy it on its own server. Unlike the serverless endpoints above, 
the server on your dedicated endpoint will serve your workloads exclusively. 

For more details, see [here](../Dedicated_Endpoints/Overview.md).

## GPU Instances

GPU instances consist of on-demand GPU virtual machines, customizable with a variety of configurations to suit you and your needs for any project.

For more details, see [here](../GPU_Instances/Overview.md).

## Configuring Auto-Pay

You can enable automatic billing (Auto-Pay) on the billing page. By adding a card to your account and configuring your Auto-Pay settings, your balance will be automatically reloaded when it nears your specified threshold. When your account balance falls below your chosen threshold, your default saved card will be charged the amount you set for Auto-Pay (maximum once per hour). 

To set up Auto-Pay, simply toggle the Auto-Pay switch, set your threshold and reload amount, and save your settings. This ensures you never run out of credits for your usage.
