# Billing Information

## How it Works

Payments are simple- you can purchase credits, which are then deducted by your product usage billing (e.g hourly usage from
your GPU instances). [Invoices](#invoices) are generated automatically for each credit purchase, and all other billing 
information is handled in the [Billing](https://nebulablock.com/billing) tab.

## Adding a Payment Card

To add a payment card, simply navigate to the "Add a New Card" button on the billing page and enter your card details. 
If the card meets the following requirements, it is added to your account successfully:
- Has valid card credentials (CVV, address, card number, etc.)
- Doesn't exist on another account
- Has enough funds available

Nebula Block accepts all types of payment cards. Note that your card may be validated for authenticity, but you will not be charged any amount during this process.

## Redeeming a Promotion Code

You can redeem a promotion code on the billing page. Simply enter your code in the "Add Promotion Code" section and click "Redeem" to apply the promotion to your account.

## Managing Payment Methods

Managing payment methods is simple via our customer portal. To change your default payment method, simply configure this 
in the [**Payment Method**](https://www.nebulablock.com/billing) section of the billing page.

## Purchasing Credits

To purchase credits, which are the sole currency that you use to make payments for our products, simply select the 
amount you wish to purchase on the billing page, then make the purchase, which will be done with your default payment card
or with a new card.

## Invoices

Transactions made on your account (e.g. when you are billed for usage) will be documented as downloadable invoices and 
listed in the [**Transaction**](https://www.nebulablock.com/billing) section of the billing page.

## Usage

To see the usage rate of your products, see the [**Usages**](https://www.nebulablock.com/billing) section of the billing page.
