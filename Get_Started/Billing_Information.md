# Billing Information

## How it Works

At Nebula Block, you pay first then your credits are depleted by your product usage (e.g. hourly usage from
your GPU instances). To get $10 in free credits, you need to [register your first payment card](#adding-a-payment-card)
on the platform. [Invoices](#invoices) are generated automatically for each transaction and you are charged monthly offline
using your default payment method. Products can not be used without a payment card set up in the customer portal.

All information regarding billing is handled in the [Billing](https://nebulablock.com/billing) tab

## Adding a Payment Card

To add a payment card, simply navigate to the "Add a New Card" button on the billing page and enter your card details.
Nebula Block accepts all types of payment cards, but a small charge of **$0.98 USD** will be applied to your card to validate
that it has funds. If the card meets the following requirements, it is added to your account successfully:
- Has valid card credentials (CVV, address, card number, etc.,)
- Doesn't exist on another account
- Has enough funds (the $0.98 USD charge will be credited to your account)

Your first card that is registered to your account will give you $10 USD in free credits!

## Managing Payment Methods

Managing payment methods is simple via our customer portal. To change your default payment method, simply configure this 
in the **Payment Method** section of the billing page.

## Purchasing Credits

To purchase credits, which are the sole currency that you can use to make payments for our products, simply select the 
amount you wish to purchase, then proceed with your default payment card. Purchasing credits is not possible if you haven't
registered at least one payment card with Nebula Block.

## Invoices

All transactions, including receiving credits, making purchases, and receiving bonus/promo credits will be documented and 
listed in the **Transaction** section of the billing page. There are downloadable invoices for each transaction.

## Usage

To see the usage rate of your products, see the **Usages** section of the billing page.
