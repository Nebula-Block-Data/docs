# Billing Information

## How it Works

At Nebula Block, you pay first by purchasing credits, which are then deducted by your product usage (e.g. hourly usage from
your GPU instances). To upgrade to **Engineer Tier 2**, you need to [register your first payment card](#adding-a-payment-card)
on the platform. [Invoices](#invoices) are generated automatically for each credit purchase.

All information regarding billing is handled in the [Billing page](https://nebulablock.com/billing) of the customer portal.

## Adding a Payment Card

To add a payment card, navigate to the "Add a New Card" button on the billing page and enter your card details.
Nebula Block accepts all types of payment cards. If the card meets the following requirements, it will be added to your account successfully:
- Has valid card credentials (CVV, address, card number, etc.,)
- Doesn't exist on another account
- Has enough funds (a $0.98 USD charge will be placed on your card and credited to your account)

## Managing Payment Methods

Managing payment methods is simple via our customer portal. To change your default payment method, configure this 
in the **Payment Method** section of the billing page.

## Purchasing Credits

To purchase credits, which are the sole currency that you use to make payments for our products, simply select the 
amount you wish to purchase on the billing page, then make the purchase, which will be done with your default payment card
or with a new card.

## Invoices

All transactions, including receiving credits, making purchases, and receiving bonus/promo credits will be documented and 
listed in the **Transactions** section of the billing page. There are downloadable invoices for each transaction.

## Usage

To see the usage rate of your products, see the **Usages** section of the billing page.
