# Quickstart

Getting started is easy! The first step is to create an account. To do so, head straight to our 
[sign-up page](https://dev-portal.nebulablock.com/register) (for more details, see our [docs](./Manage_Accounts.md)). 
You'll receive a 1$ free credit (and up to 9\$ extra credits if you have a referral code!).

Using our products then depends on your account tier. Your tier dictates your rate limits and the features you can access. 
In short, serverless endpoints are available to all tiers, but to access GPUs you'll need to upgrade your tier by
depositing 10$. For more details on how the tier system works, please see the [Tier](../Tier/Overview.md) section.
