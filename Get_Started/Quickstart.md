# Quickstart

Getting started is easy! 

The first step is to create an [account](https://dev-portal.nebulablock.com/register) (for more details, see our [docs](./Manage_Accounts.md)). 
You'll receive a 1$ free credit (and up to 9\$ extra credits if you have a referral code!).

Using our products then depends on your account tier. In short: 

- [Serverless Endpoints](../Serverless_Endpoints/Overview.md) are available to all tiers (request and token limits increasing with tier level)
- [GPU Instances](../GPU_Instances/Overview.md) require a 10$ credit purchase 

For more details on how the tier system works, please see the [Tier](../Tier/Overview.md) section.
